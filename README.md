# Healthcare-Management-Database
Created in Spring 2021 for COSC 3318 - Database Management Systems

**Background**

This project was created in a group of four people, and one of my groupmates had previous work experience in the medical industry.
He talked about how outdated a lot of their database systems were. This lead us to create our own modernized database system.

**About the Project**

The functionalities included the ability for searching and storing of worker and patient information on an easy-to-use-display.
The program utilized Java Netbeans to create a simple and intuitive UI for both patients and medical staff alike and was hosted on a local database.
